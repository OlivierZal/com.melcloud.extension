# CLAUDE.md

Homey app extending com.melcloud with automatic cooling adjustment based
on an outdoor temperature source. ESM only, Node >= 22.19. It talks to
the MELCloud devices exclusively through the local Homey API (`homey-api`)
— device behavior is fixed in com.melcloud (sibling repo with its own
CLAUDE.md), never worked around here.

## Commands

Run the FULL suite before any push — CI runs all of it:

- `npm run format` / `npm run format:fix` — prettier (eslint does NOT
  cover formatting).
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` — ESLint (also lints CSS, HTML,
  JSON, YAML and Markdown via the language plugins).
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc` from `@typescript/native` (TypeScript 7).
- `npm test` / `npm run test:coverage` — vitest; backend coverage is at
  100% (branches included), keep it there. `settings/` is browser glue
  and excluded.
- `npm run build` — esbuild bundle (`scripts/bundle.mjs`) + `tsc` emit.
  `settings/index.mjs` is a gitignored build output, never checked in;
  the Homey CLI regenerates it on validate/install/run.
- `npm run homey:validate` — Homey validation at publish level; may
  rewrite files (locales), re-stage if it does.
- `npm run homey:start` — `homey app run --remote` for on-device testing.

Check real exit codes; never pipe a check's output through `tail`/`grep`
to judge success.

## Architecture

- `app.mts` — discovers the MELCloud AC devices (`ATA_DRIVER_IDS`
  matches BOTH dialects: Classic `melcloud` and MELCloud Home
  `home-melcloud`; the app id `com.mecloud` is a historical typo) and
  the temperature sensors, debounces device events, and owns the
  `OutdoorTemperatureListener` instance.
- `listeners/` — instance-based: `OutdoorTemperatureListener` owns the
  registry of `MELCloudListener`s and injects itself into each one (no
  static cross-references; melcloud.mts only imports the outdoor
  listener as a type, so there is no runtime cycle).
- `settings/index.mts` — browser-side settings UI, bundled by esbuild
  into `settings/index.mjs` (ES module). `onHomeyReady` is exposed via
  `Object.assign(globalThis, { onHomeyReady })`.
- `homey-api-override.d.ts` — ambient module declaration for the
  homey-api surface actually used; `homey-override.d.ts` types the app
  settings. `lib/homey.mts` re-exports the runtime-provided `homey` SDK
  (the scoped eslint carve-out for `import-x/no-extraneous-dependencies`
  lives there, not inline).

## Platform gotchas

- `.homeycompose/` is the SOURCE for `app.json` and `locales/*.json`;
  commit the CLI-generated outputs verbatim (no trailing newline).
- Home ATA devices (`home-melcloud`) do NOT expose
  `measure_temperature.outdoor`; only Classic ATA devices do. The
  default outdoor-source selection and the sensor list must never
  assume it.
- Both ATA drivers share `thermostat_mode` values (incl. `cool`) and
  the 10–31 °C `target_temperature` range; the setpoint ceiling is read
  from `capabilitiesObj` at runtime (31 °C fallback).
- The threshold (user comfort setpoint) is persisted per device id in
  the `thresholds` setting; reverting falls back to 0 °C if the stored
  entry disappeared.

## Lint doctrine

- Code adapts to the rules, never the reverse. Never add a disable —
  not inline, not through config options or ignore regexes: refactor
  until the rule passes. One counterweight: when every compliant shape
  reads worse than the violation (a rule-pair conflict, a
  protocol-imposed form), the documented disable IS the honest form.
  Current irreducibles: the fire-and-forget rule trio
  (`lib/fire-and-forget.mts`, settings copy) and the TS9019
  isolatedDeclarations carve-out in `lib/homey.mts`.
- Naming is stricter than com.melcloud: properties are camelCase-only
  in app code. The tests block relaxes it (documented in the config)
  because test doubles mirror external contracts: capability ids
  (snake_case, dotted), device ids (hyphenated), module export names
  (PascalCase) and Homey's `__` translation method.
- Ambient `*.d.ts` files have a scoped carve-out (script parse,
  namespace-merged classes) — also documented in the config.
- Zero-warning policy: every enabled rule is at `error`.
- Test doubles are SYNC where the real API is async (the caller's
  `await` handles both): `mockImplementation(async …)` without an await
  trips `require-await`, and non-async promise-returning arrows trip
  `promise-function-async` — type the `vi.fn` as value-returning
  instead.
- `useDefineForClassFields` wipes fields assigned by `super()`: a
  subclass re-declaring an Error option (like `cause`) must use
  `declare`, not a field initializer.

## Repo process

- `main` is protected (PRs only, squash merges); CI must be green.
  Copilot reviews every PR — answer every comment, verify its claims
  against sources before acting, and resolve the thread once settled.
- Homey App Store releases: write the user-facing changelog entry into
  `.homeychangelog.json` under the NEW version key (all 7 locales:
  da/en/es/fr/nl/no/sv), bump `version` in `.homeycompose/app.json`,
  align `package.json` via `npm version X.Y.Z --no-git-tag-version`,
  run `homey:validate` to regenerate `app.json`, and land it all
  through a PR. Then tag `vX.Y.Z` and publish a GitHub release:
  `publish.yml` fires on release-published (environment `homey`,
  `HOMEY_PAT`) and pushes to the App Store.
- Store submissions: a rejected version number cannot be resubmitted —
  bump the patch version.
- Sonar: the CI upload step is gated on the `SONAR_TOKEN` secret; add
  the secret to enable coverage on SonarCloud.
